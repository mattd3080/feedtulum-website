## CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### IMMEDIATE (This Week)

**1. VERIFY W.K. Kellogg Foundation**
- Contact: wkkf.org/grantseekers
- Question: "Can a US-based 501(c)(3) apply for funding for programs in Mexico, specifically in Quintana Roo/Tulum?"
- **IF YES:** HIGH PRIORITY - Tulum is in their priority region!
- **IF NO:** Disqualify

**2. VERIFY Raskob Foundation**
- Contact: rfca.org
- Questions:
  - "Can a US-based 501(c)(3) apply for international grants to Mexico?"
  - "Must the applicant be a Mexican Catholic organization, or can US Catholic nonprofits apply for Mexico work?"
  - "Does Feed Tulum need formal Catholic Church recognition?"
- Next deadline: June 8 - Aug 8, 2026 (reviewed November)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (This Month)

**3. Complete Existing Applications**
- Global Fund for Children: Submit LOI
- Conservation, Food & Health: Prepare concept note (due June 16, 2026)

**4. Investigate Koch Foundation (if feasible)**
- Research: Can Feed Tulum find a fiscal agent in Official Catholic Directory?
- If solution found: Apply Jan 1 - May 1 for 2027 funding

## REALISTIC FUNDING POTENTIAL

### Conservative Scenario (20% success rate)
- W.K. Kellogg: $30,000 (if qualified)
- Global Fund for Children: $40,000
- CFH Foundation: $35,000
- **Total:** $105,000

### Optimistic Scenario (40% success rate + Raskob)
- W.K. Kellogg: $40,000
- Global Fund for Children: $50,000
- CFH Foundation: $40,000
- Raskob: $25,000 (if qualified)
- **Total:** $155,000

### Reality Check
With 65+ funders researched and only 2-5 qualified, securing 1-2 grants totaling $50,000-$100,000 would be a strong outcome.

## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. The "Invitation-Only" Barrier is MASSIVE
Over half (52%) of major foundations do not accept unsolicited proposals. They proactively identify organizations to invite. This creates an insurmountable barrier for newer/smaller organizations without established relationships.

### 2. US-Based Working Internationally is RARE
Most US foundations fund either:
- US domestic programs only
- International programs through large established partners
- Very few fund small US-based orgs doing direct international work

### 3. The Kellogg Opportunity Could Be Huge
If W.K. Kellogg accepts US 501(c)(3)s for Mexico work, Feed Tulum has a PERFECT fit:
- Tulum is in Quintana Roo (Yucatan Peninsula = their priority region!)
- Programs align: food systems, children, education
- Rolling deadline = flexible timing

### 4. Catholic Foundations Offer Potential
Raskob and Koch explicitly include Mexico, but both have complications:
- Raskob: Unclear if US orgs qualify or only Mexican Catholic entities
- Koch: Requires US Catholic fiscal agent

### 5. Corporate Foundations are Fragmented
Most operate separate foundations in each country (Walmart Mexico, etc.), making it difficult for US-based orgs to access.

## WHAT WORKED / WHAT DIDN'T

### ✅ What Worked:
- Systematic category-by-category research
- Quick disqualification when obvious barriers found
- Focus on mission-aligned funders (food, children, Latin America)

### ❌ What Didn't Work:
- Searching major food security foundations (all US-focused)
- Searching children's foundations (mostly invitation-only or Africa-focused)
- Searching sustainable agriculture foundations (US-only or wrong regions)
- Corporate giving programs (US-managed or country-specific)

### 🔍 Still Need to Research:
- Small family foundations (requires Candid subscription)
- Grant databases (requires paid subscriptions)
- Mexican foundations (would need Mexican fiscal sponsor)

---

## ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES TO CONSIDER

### Option 1: Mexican Fiscal Sponsorship
Partner with a Mexican nonprofit as fiscal sponsor to unlock:
- Inter-American Foundation (requires org based in Latin America)
- Mexican corporate foundations
- Foundations requiring local registration

### Option 2: Focus on Catholic Identity
If Feed Tulum can establish formal Catholic Church connection:
- Raskob Foundation becomes viable
- Koch Foundation becomes viable (with fiscal agent)
- Other Catholic foundations may open up

### Option 3: Partnership with Established Organizations
Rather than direct grants, partner with:
- Catholic Relief Services (works in Mexico)
- World Vision (food security focus)
- Caritas Mexico (Catholic social services)

These organizations receive large grants and may sub-grant to local partners.

### Option 4: Individual Donor Cultivation
With limited institutional funding available, focus on:
- Major individual donors interested in Mexico
- Corporate matching gifts
- Crowdfunding campaigns
- Monthly donor programs

## COMPARISON TO ORIGINAL GOAL

**Original Goal:** Find 10-20 qualified grants
**Actual Result:** 2 confirmed + 3 pending verification = 5 total possible

**Success Rate:** 25-50% of goal

**Why the Gap?**
1. Grant landscape much more restrictive than anticipated
2. US-based orgs working internationally face unique barriers
3. Mexico not prioritized by many Latin America funders (focus on Central/South America)
4. Invitation-only culture dominates foundation world

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**STOP SEARCHING. START APPLYING.**

With 65+ funders researched and 92% disqualification rate, diminishing returns on continued searching.

**Better strategy:**
1. **Verify** W.K. Kellogg and Raskob immediately
2. **Apply** to 2-3 qualified grants with STRONG, CUSTOMIZED applications
3. **Cultivate** individual donors and corporate partners
4. **Consider** fiscal sponsorship or partnership strategies

**One excellent grant application is worth more than 10 mediocre searches.**
