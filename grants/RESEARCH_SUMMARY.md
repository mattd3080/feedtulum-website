# Grant Research Summary - Feed Tulum
## Research Completed: January 24, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Total Grants Researched:** 35+
**Qualified Grants Found:** 3 (1 new, pending verification)
**Disqualification Rate:** 91%

**Key Finding:** The grant landscape for US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofits working internationally in Mexico is extremely limited. Most funders either:
1. Do not accept unsolicited proposals (invitation-only)
2. Focus on US-domestic programs only
3. Require organizations to be based IN the country of operation
4. Focus on different geographic regions (Africa, Asia, etc.)

## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. The "Invitation-Only" Problem
Over half of foundations do not accept unsolicited proposals. They proactively identify and invite organizations to apply. This creates a barrier for newer or smaller organizations without established relationships.

**Recommendation:** Focus limited time on the 3 qualified grants rather than pursuing invitation-only funders.

### 2. Geographic Restrictions Are Strict
Many foundations that fund "internationally" have very specific country lists, and Mexico is often not included (especially in agriculture/environment).

**Notable:** Patagonia funds Argentina and Chile but NOT Mexico.

### 3. US-Based vs. Locally-Based Matters
Several funders (Inter-American Foundation, potentially others) require organizations to be based IN the country where they operate, not US-based working internationally.

**W.K. Kellogg is unique** in funding the Yucatan Peninsula region where Tulum is located.

### 4. Corporate Giving is Fragmented
Corporate foundations often have separate entities in each country (Walmart Mexico Foundation, etc.) making it difficult for US-based orgs to access.

## PRIORITY ACTIONS

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)

**1. VERIFY W.K. Kellogg Foundation Eligibility**
- Contact: Visit wkkf.org/grantseekers
- Question: "Can a US-based 501(c)(3) apply for funding for programs in Mexico (specifically Quintana Roo/Tulum)?"
- If YES → High priority application (Tulum is in their priority region!)
- If NO → Skip

**2. Complete Applications for Confirmed Grants**
- Global Fund for Children: Letter of Inquiry (rolling)
- Conservation, Food & Health Foundation: Concept note (deadline June 16, 2026)

### Medium-Term (30-90 Days)

**3. Alternative Search Strategies**
Based on disqualification patterns, try:
- **Small family foundations** focused on Mexico/food/children (less researched)
- **Faith-based foundations** with Mexico missions
- **Corporate community grants** from companies with Tulum operations
- **Mexican grant databases** (if Feed Tulum can partner with a Mexican fiscal sponsor)

**4. Explore Fiscal Sponsorship in Mexico**
Several funders require local registration. Partnering with a Mexican nonprofit as fiscal sponsor could unlock:
- Inter-American Foundation
- Potentially others that require local presence

---

## WHAT DIDN'T WORK

These strategies yielded no results:
- ❌ Searching major food security foundations (all US-focused or invitation-only)
- ❌ Searching children's foundations (Africa-focused or invitation-only)
- ❌ Searching sustainable agriculture foundations (US-only or specific countries excluding Mexico)
- ❌ Searching corporate giving programs (US-focused or managed locally in Mexico)

---

## REALISTIC FUNDING POTENTIAL

**Conservative Scenario (25% success rate):**
- W.K. Kellogg: $30,000 (if qualified and successful)
- Global Fund for Children: $40,000 (midpoint)
- CFH Foundation: $37,500 (midpoint)
- **Total:** $107,500

**Optimistic Scenario (50% success rate):**
- W.K. Kellogg: $40,000
- Global Fund for Children: $50,000
- CFH Foundation: $40,000
- **Total:** $130,000

**Reality Check:**
With only 3 qualified grants and high competition, securing 1-2 grants totaling $50,000-$80,000 would be a strong outcome.

---

## NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

If more grants needed:

1. **Grant Databases**
   - Search Candid Foundation Directory for "Mexico" + "Food" + "Children"
   - Filter for organizations with <$1M in assets (less competition)

2. **Faith-Based Foundations**
   - Catholic foundations with Mexico missions
   - Protestant mission organizations
   - Research not yet conducted

3. **Regional/State Foundations**
   - Texas foundations (border region focus)
   - California foundations (Mexico ties)

4. **Mexican Foundations**
   - Mexican corporate foundations
   - Mexican community foundations
   - Would require local partnership

---

## CONCLUSION

The grant landscape for Feed Tulum is challenging but not impossible. The organization has **3 solid opportunities** (2 confirmed, 1 pending verification).

**Critical Next Step:** Verify W.K. Kellogg Foundation eligibility immediately. If confirmed, Feed Tulum would have an excellent fit with a major funder that specifically prioritizes the Yucatan Peninsula region where Tulum is located.

**Recommendation:** Focus resources on applying to the 3 qualified grants with strong, customized applications rather than continuing to search for additional opportunities that face 90%+ disqualification rates.
