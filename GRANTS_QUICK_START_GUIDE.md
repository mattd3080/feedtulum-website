## ⚡ TODAY'S ACTION PLAN (Do This First!)

### ✅ STEP 1: Apply to W.K. Kellogg Foundation (20 minutes)

**WHY FIRST:** Tulum is in their PRIORITY REGION (Quintana Roo/Yucatan Peninsula). They specifically fund nutrition + education for Mayan children in this exact area. Rolling deadline. 30-day response time.

**WHAT YOU NEED:**
1. Go to: https://feedtulum.com/grants
2. Login password: `FeedTulum!Grants2026`
3. Click on "W.K. Kellogg Foundation" grant card
4. Read the application criteria
5. Copy ONE of the 3 LOI versions (all are ready to submit!)
6. Go to wkkf.fluxx.io and register
7. Paste LOI and submit
8. Done! Response in 30 days.

**PRO TIP:** Use VERSION 1 (multi-priority focus) unless you have a reason to emphasize food systems or racial equity specifically.

**SUCCESS FACTOR:** QUINTANA ROO IS THEIR PRIORITY REGION. This alone makes you a strong candidate.

---

### ✅ STEP 2: Apply to Global Fund for Children (20 minutes)

**WHY SECOND:** Perfect fit for grassroots, locally-led organization. They were first funder for 83% of grantees - they WANT small organizations like Feed Tulum. Rolling deadline.

**WHAT YOU NEED:**
1. Go to: https://feedtulum.com/grants
2. Click on "Global Fund for Children" grant card
3. Copy the Expression of Interest (EOI) responses
4. Go to globalfundforchildren.org/become-a-partner
5. Fill out EOI form (available in Spanish too!)
6. Paste your responses
7. Submit
8. Done! GFC will contact if aligned.

**PRO TIP:** Emphasize that your team LIVES IN TULUM (not expats flying in). This is huge for GFC's "lived experience" requirement.

**SUCCESS FACTOR:** Grassroots + community-led + lived experience = exactly what GFC funds.

---

### ✅ STEP 3: Prepare CFH Foundation Application (Do in April/May)

**WHY THIRD:** Concept note due June 16, 2026. Need to prepare 2-page document. More work than the others but good fit.

**TIMELINE:**
- **April 2026:** Draft 2-page concept note
- **May 2026:** Get feedback, revise
- **June 1-15, 2026:** Submit via online portal

**WHAT YOU NEED:**
1. Complete 2-page concept note (template provided at feedtulum.com/grants)
2. Basic budget outline
3. Submit between May 1 - June 15, 2026

**PRO TIP:** Start drafting in April. The 2-page limit is STRICT - they won't read beyond page 2.

**SUCCESS FACTOR:** Emphasize CAPACITY BUILDING (teaching kids to farm) not charity (giving food). CFH loves this approach.
